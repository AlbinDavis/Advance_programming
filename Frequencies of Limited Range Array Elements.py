# Given an array A[] of N positive integers which can contain integers from 1 to P where elements can be repeated or can be absent from the array. Your task is to count the frequency of all elements from 1 to N.


# Example 1:

# Input:
# N = 5
# arr[] = {2, 3, 2, 3, 5}
# P = 5
# Output:
# 0 2 2 0 1
# Explanation: 
# Counting frequencies of each array element
# We have:
# 1 occurring 0 times.
# 2 occurring 2 times.
# 3 occurring 2 times.
# 4 occurring 0 times.
# 5 occurring 1 time.
# Example 2:

# Input:
# N = 4
# arr[] = {3,3,3,3}
# P = 3
# Output:
# 0 0 4 0
# Explanation: 
# Counting frequencies of each array element
# We have:
# 1 occurring 0 times.
# 2 occurring 0 times.
# 3 occurring 4 times.
# 4 occurring 0 times.

# Your Task:
# Complete the function frequencycount() that takes the array and n as input parameters and returns an array in place to denote the frequency count of each element from 1 to N. i,e element at index 0 should represent frequency of 1 and so on.


# Expected Time Complexity: O(N logN)
# Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)




def frequencyCount(self, arr, N, P):
    dic=Counter(arr)
    arr.clear()
    for i in range(N):
        if i+1 in dic:
            arr.append(dic[i+1])
        else:
    	        arr.append(0)
